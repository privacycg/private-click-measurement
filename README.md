## Introduction

A popular business model for the web is to get attribution and payment for conversions, for instance purchases or sign-ups, which result from the click on an ad. Traditionally, such attribution has been facilitated by user identifying cookies sent in third-party HTTP requests to the click source. However, the same technology can be and has been used for privacy invasive cross-site tracking of users.

The technology described [in this draft specification](https://privacycg.github.io/private-click-measurement/) is intended to allow for ad click attribution while disallowing arbitrary cross-site tracking.

## Goals

* Support ad click attribution.

* Preserve user privacy, specifically prevent cross-site tracking of users.
